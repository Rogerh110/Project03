    <h3> 1. Orange cats are not a breed of their own</h3>
    <p>Orange cats are not their own breed. Orange is just a coat color, a variation that can be seen in many breeds
      of cats. Shades can vary from pale orange to a very rich almost red color.</p>
    <h3>2. Orange cats are not a solid color </h3>
    <p>
      Orange cats are never solid in color, instead, they are always striped, a pattern that is known as tabby. There
      are variations in the types of stripes each cat has. There are 4 main patterns seen - </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Mackerel - tiger-like stripes </li>
      <li> alternating light and dark bands</li>
      <li> Spotted - the cat has spots instead of tiger stripes</li>
      <li> Classic - a swirled pattern</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> 3. Most orange cats are marked with an 'M'</h3>
    <p>Due to their tabby cat stripes, most orange cats will have an M-shaped marking on their forehead. There are many
      legends surrounding this M. The first is from the ancient Egyptians where cats were called Mau (due to the noise
      they make). The Islamic world suggests that Mohammed had a tabby called Muezza who saved his master’s life. Every
      tabby born with an M is a reminder of Mohammed's love for his cat. Others believe the mark came from Mary stroking
      atabby cat that kept baby Jesus warm in his manger.</p>
    <h3>4. Orange male cats outnumber female cats</h3>
    <p>Orange males are much more common than orange females. It is thought that 80% of orange cats are male! This is
      because the gene that controls color is linked to sex, with the code for the orange color found on the X
      chromosome.
      As female cats have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y chromosome, this means that a female cat needs
      to inherit two orange genes in order to be orange in color (one from each parent) whereas a male cat only needs to
      inherit one. The chance of receiving two orange genes is unlikely, given that other colors are more often more
      prevalent in the cat population, like black. This explains why male cats are much more likely to be orange than
      females.</p>
    <h3>5. The orange color is due to a pigment found in red-haired people too</h3>
    <p>Though the exact shade of orange can vary considerably between cats, it is all due to a particular pigment called
      pheomelanin. This is the same pigment that causes red hair in people too!</p>
    <h3>6. Orange cats can have short or long hair</h3>
    <p>A variety of breeds can have orange fur. Long-haired breeds like Persians, Turkish Angora cats, and Maine coons
      can all carry orange tabby colorations. Equally orange hues are seen in exotic shorthairs, the Devon Rex, and
      Scottish folds. Outside of pedigree breeds, the orange tabby color can exist in both domestic short-haired and
      domestic long-haired moggies.</p>
    <h3>7. There are lots of orange celebrity cats!</h3>
    <p>We seem to be attracted to orange cats, and there are many celebrity ones that are a testament to this! Garfield
      is a very famous orange cat with a sassy attitude and penchant for lasagne. But Puss in Boots in Shrek is also an
      orange tabby, as is Heathcliff and also Crookshanks in Harry Potter (Hermione’s pet).</p>
    <h3>8. They tend to develop black freckles</h3>
    <p>Black freckles are a common finding in orange cats. These tend to be most obvious around the lips and nose, and
      areas where the fur is thin. These marks don’t tend to develop until the cat is a year or two of age and are
      similar to freckles found in red-headed humans.</p>
    <h3>9. Orange cats can have a variety of eye colors</h3>
    <p>The eyes of ginger cats can be bright blue, striking green, golden, or even copper in color. Blue eyes are much
      less common than some of the other shades, however. Most orange cats will have green or gold-colored eyes.</p>
    <h3> 10. Their color inspires a variety of names</h3>
    <p>The names that people give their orange cats are often inspired by their beautiful fur color. Some of the more
      common ones include the likes of Rusty, Ginger, Tigger, Marmalade, Cheeto, and Garfield.
